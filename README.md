# storm-black-test
Storm Black React Test

```
Installation:

clone git rep
npm install / yarn install
npm start / yarn start
```

```
Known Issues [== things I didn't have time to deal with]:
    - console errors: mostly lib / framework erros
    - Aggregate SelectedChips not working properly (see [a link](https://github.com/YuvalBB/storm-black-test/blob/master/src/components/SelectedChipsAggregateBug/SelectedChips.tsx))
        - Therefore, used [a link](https://github.com/YuvalBB/storm-black-test/blob/master/src/components/SelectedChipsNoAggregate/SelectedChips.tsx) instead, with no aggregation.
    - Not fully TypeScript
    - Messy styling / stylesheets
    - Could be more pretty ;)
