Storm Black React Test

```
Installation:

clone git rep
npm install / yarn install
npm start / yarn start
```

```
Known Issues [or things I didn't have time to deal with]:
    - console errors: mostly lib / framework erros
    - Aggregate SelectedChips not working properly (see (src/components/SelectedChipsAggregateBug/SelectedChips.tsx))
        - Therefore, used (src/components/SelectedChipsNoAggregate/SelectedChips.tsx) instead, with no aggregation.
    - Not fully TypeScript
    - Messy styling / stylesheets
```
